# JavaScript Slider

This slider was forked from [this repo](https://github.com/codebubb/javascript-slider) and was modified to use SVGs for the prev/next buttons and to stop auto play when a prev/next button or a pager is clicked.

View the slider [here](https://fettabachi.github.io/javascript-slider/).

### Description

This slider features prev/next buttons, autoplay and pagers to skip between slides. It was built using a javascript class making it easy to use in other applications. It's made very flexible by allowing you to pass configuration details to the slider.
