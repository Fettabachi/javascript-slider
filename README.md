# JavaScript Slider

This slider was forked from [this repo](https://github.com/codebubb/javascript-slider) and was modified to use SVGs for the prev/next buttons and to stop auto play when a prev/next button or a pager is clicked.

### To Do.

  - ~~stop auto play when the next button is clicked~~
  - prevent rewind/fast-forward when paging past the lastslide or before the 1st slide
  - ~~implement a webpack workflow~~
